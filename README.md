- Vectorization using TF-IDF
- Classification using machine learning models
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/JyothiBommisetty/spam-detection.git
cd spam_detection

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install the dependencies**
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   jupyter notebook

   
🧠 **Model & Dataset**
The notebook uses basic NLP techniques and Scikit-learn models. You can use the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
